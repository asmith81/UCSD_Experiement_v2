# Model Processing Protocol Review

## Protocol Name
Model Processing Protocol

## Definition Location
interface_control_document.md (Section 1.2)

## Current Implementation
src/execution.py and src/models/common.py

## Review Checklist

### 1. Function Signature Compliance
- [x] Function name matches protocol (ModelProcessor)
- [x] Parameters match protocol definition (model, prompt_template, case)
- [x] Return type matches protocol (Dict[str, Any])
- [x] Type hints are implemented

### 2. Behavior Compliance
- [ ] Function behavior matches protocol description
  - Issue: Inconsistent input/output formats across models
- [x] Error handling follows protocol
- [x] Logging requirements are met
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
  - Issue: No clear performance metrics defined

### 3. Documentation Compliance
- [x] Docstring matches protocol documentation
- [x] Parameters are documented
- [x] Return values are documented
- [x] Exceptions are documented

### 4. Integration Points
- [x] Dependencies are properly injected
- [ ] Configuration is properly handled
  - Issue: Inconsistent config handling across models
- [x] Error propagation is correct

## Implementation Issues

### Missing Requirements
1. Standardized input/output format
   - Impact: Inconsistent processing results across models
   - Priority: High

2. Performance metrics
   - Impact: Cannot measure or compare processing performance
   - Priority: Medium

3. Model-specific validation
   - Impact: Potential runtime errors from invalid inputs
   - Priority: High

### Implementation Deviations
1. Custom preprocessing steps
   - Justification: Model-specific requirements
   - Required Changes: Document model-specific preprocessing

2. Extended output fields
   - Justification: Additional model information
   - Required Changes: Document extended fields

### Additional Functionality
1. Batch processing
   - Justification: Performance optimization
   - Recommendation: Keep but document as extension

2. Custom postprocessing
   - Justification: Model-specific requirements
   - Recommendation: Move to separate postprocessing protocol

## Action Items

2. Document extended fields
   - Timeline: This week

### Low Priority
1. Implement batch processing
   - Timeline: Next week
   - Owner: [Team Member]

## Review Notes
- Core processing implementation needs standardization
- Model-specific requirements should be documented
- Consider creating separate preprocessing/postprocessing protocols
- Need to define clear performance metrics
