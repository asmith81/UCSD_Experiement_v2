# Result Storage Protocol Review

## Protocol Name
Result Storage Protocol

## Definition Location
interface_control_document.md (Section 1.3)

## Current Implementation
src/results_logging.py

## Review Checklist

### 1. Function Signature Compliance
- [x] Function name matches protocol (ResultStorage)
- [x] Parameters match protocol definition (result_path, result)
- [x] Return type matches protocol (None)
- [x] Type hints are implemented

### 2. Behavior Compliance
- [ ] Function behavior matches protocol description
  - Issue: Overlapping functionality with raw_test_execution.py
- [x] Error handling follows protocol
- [x] Logging requirements are met
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
  - Issue: No clear performance metrics defined

### 3. Documentation Compliance
- [x] Docstring matches protocol documentation
- [x] Parameters are documented
- [x] Return values are documented
- [x] Exceptions are documented

### 4. Integration Points
- [x] Dependencies are properly injected
- [ ] Configuration is properly handled
  - Issue: Inconsistent config handling across implementations
- [x] Error propagation is correct

## Implementation Issues

### Missing Requirements
1. Standardized result structure
   - Impact: Inconsistent result formats across implementations
   - Priority: High

2. Performance metrics
   - Impact: Cannot measure or compare storage performance
   - Priority: Medium

3. Result validation
   - Impact: Potential storage of invalid results
   - Priority: High

### Implementation Deviations
1. Extended storage options
   - Justification: Additional storage requirements
   - Required Changes: Document extended options

2. Custom result processing
   - Justification: Additional processing needs
   - Required Changes: Move to separate processing protocol

### Additional Functionality
1. Result aggregation
   - Justification: Analysis requirements
   - Recommendation: Keep but document as extension

2. Custom serialization
   - Justification: Performance optimization
   - Recommendation: Keep but document as extension

2. Document extended options
   - Timeline: This week

### Low Priority
1. Implement result aggregation
   - Timeline: Next week

## Review Notes
- Core storage implementation needs standardization
- Overlapping functionality needs consolidation
- Consider creating separate processing protocol
- Need to define clear performance metrics
