# Image Processing Protocol Review

## Protocol Name
Image Processing Protocol

## Definition Location
interface_control_document.md (Section 1.4)

## Current Implementation
src/data_utils.py

## Review Checklist

### 1. Function Signature Compliance
- [x] Function name matches protocol (ImageProcessor)
- [x] Parameters match protocol definition (image, config)
- [x] Return type matches protocol (Image.Image)
- [x] Type hints are implemented

### 2. Behavior Compliance
- [ ] Function behavior matches protocol description
  - Issue: Missing validation in some areas
- [x] Error handling follows protocol
- [x] Logging requirements are met
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
  - Issue: No clear performance metrics defined

### 3. Documentation Compliance
- [x] Docstring matches protocol documentation
- [x] Parameters are documented
- [x] Return values are documented
- [x] Exceptions are documented

### 4. Integration Points
- [x] Dependencies are properly injected
- [ ] Configuration is properly handled
  - Issue: Inconsistent config handling
- [x] Error propagation is correct

## Implementation Issues

### Missing Requirements
1. Complete validation
   - Impact: Potential processing of invalid images
   - Priority: High

2. Performance metrics
   - Impact: Cannot measure or compare processing performance
   - Priority: Medium

3. Standardized configuration
   - Impact: Inconsistent processing across implementations
   - Priority: High

### Implementation Deviations
1. Extended preprocessing
   - Justification: Additional processing requirements
   - Required Changes: Document extended processing

2. Custom format handling
   - Justification: Additional format support
   - Required Changes: Document supported formats

### Additional Functionality
1. Image caching
   - Justification: Performance optimization
   - Recommendation: Keep but document as extension

2. Custom transformations
   - Justification: Additional processing needs
   - Recommendation: Move to separate transformation protocol

## Review Notes
- Core processing implementation needs validation
- Configuration handling needs standardization
- Consider creating separate transformation protocol
- Need to define clear performance metrics
