# Model Loading Protocol Review

## Protocol Name
Model Loading Protocol

## Definition Location
interface_control_document.md (Section 1.1)

## Current Implementation
src/execution.py and src/models/*.py

## Review Checklist

### 1. Function Signature Compliance
- [x] Function name matches protocol (ModelLoader)
- [x] Parameters match protocol definition (model_name: str, quantization: int)
- [x] Return type matches protocol (Any)
- [x] Type hints are implemented

### 2. Behavior Compliance
- [ ] Function behavior matches protocol description
  - Issue: Inconsistent quantization handling across implementations
- [x] Error handling follows protocol
- [x] Logging requirements are met
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
  - Issue: No clear performance metrics defined

### 3. Documentation Compliance
- [x] Docstring matches protocol documentation
- [x] Parameters are documented
- [x] Return values are documented
- [x] Exceptions are documented

### 4. Integration Points
- [x] Dependencies are properly injected
- [ ] Configuration is properly handled
  - Issue: Inconsistent config handling across models
- [x] Error propagation is correct

## Implementation Issues

### Missing Requirements
1. Standardized quantization handling
   - Impact: Inconsistent model loading across different quantization levels
   - Priority: High

2. Performance metrics
   - Impact: Cannot measure or compare loading performance
   - Priority: Medium

3. Configuration validation
   - Impact: Potential runtime errors from invalid configs
   - Priority: High

### Implementation Deviations
1. Custom model-specific parameters
   - Justification: Different models require different parameters
   - Required Changes: Document model-specific requirements

2. Inconsistent error handling
   - Justification: None
   - Required Changes: Standardize error types and messages

### Additional Functionality
1. Model caching
   - Justification: Performance optimization
   - Recommendation: Keep but document as extension

2. Custom preprocessing
   - Justification: Model-specific requirements
   - Recommendation: Move to separate preprocessing protocol

### Medium Priority
1. Add performance metrics
   - Timeline: This week
   - Owner: [Team Member]

2. Document model-specific parameters
   - Timeline: This week
   - Owner: [Team Member]

### Low Priority
1. Implement model caching
   - Timeline: Next week
   - Owner: [Team Member]

## Review Notes
- Core protocol implementation is solid but needs standardization
- Model-specific requirements should be documented separately
- Consider creating a model-specific configuration protocol
- Need to define clear performance metrics
