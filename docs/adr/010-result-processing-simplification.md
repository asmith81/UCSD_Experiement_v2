# ADR 010: Result Processing Simplification

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Result processing is currently implemented with complex logic in notebooks, making it difficult to maintain and reuse. The interface control document defines a Result Storage Protocol that should be followed.

## Decision
Create a standardized result processing module in `src/results.py` that implements the Result Storage Protocol from the interface control document.

## Consequences
- Reusable result processing logic
- Consistent result storage across notebooks
- Better error handling and logging
- Easier result analysis and visualization

## Implementation
1. Create `src/results.py` with standardized result processing
2. Update notebooks to use the new module
3. Remove duplicate result processing code from notebooks

## Compliance
This change follows the Result Storage Protocol defined in section 1.4 of the interface control document.
