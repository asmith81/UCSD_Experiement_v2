# ADR 008: Model Loading Standardization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Model loading is currently implemented differently across notebooks, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors. The interface control document defines a standard Model Loading Protocol that should be followed.

## Decision
Create a standardized model loading module in `src/models/loader.py` that implements the Model Loading Protocol from the interface control document.

## Consequences
- Consistent model loading across all notebooks
- Reduced code duplication
- Better error handling and logging
- Easier model updates and maintenance

## Implementation
1. Create `src/models/loader.py` with standardized model loading
2. Update notebooks to use the new module
3. Remove duplicate model loading code from notebooks

## Compliance
This change follows the Model Loading Protocol defined in section 1.5 of the interface control document.
