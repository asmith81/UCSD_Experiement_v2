# ADR 009: Test Execution Simplification

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Test execution is currently implemented with complex logic in notebooks, making it difficult to maintain and reuse. The interface control document defines a Test Execution interface that should be followed.

## Decision
Create a standardized test execution module in `src/execution.py` that implements the Test Execution interface from the interface control document.

## Consequences
- Reusable test execution logic
- Consistent test execution across notebooks
- Better error handling and logging
- Easier test suite maintenance

## Implementation
1. Create `src/execution.py` with standardized test execution
2. Update notebooks to use the new module
3. Remove duplicate test execution code from notebooks

## Compliance
This change follows the Test Execution interface defined in section 1.6 of the interface control document.
