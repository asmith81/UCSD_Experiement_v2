# ADR 007: Environment Setup Simplification

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The current environment setup in notebooks is overly complex and duplicated across multiple notebooks. This violates the DRY principle and makes maintenance difficult.

## Decision
Move environment setup to a dedicated utility module in `src/environment.py` that follows the interface control document specifications.

## Consequences
- Reduced code duplication
- Centralized environment configuration
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Consistent environment setup across notebooks

## Implementation
1. Create `src/environment.py` with standardized environment setup
2. Update notebooks to use the new module
3. Remove duplicate environment setup code from notebooks

## Compliance
This change follows the Environment Setup interface defined in section 1.1 of the interface control document.
